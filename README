I did some work over the weekend to fix the blocking nature of
the plugin. I switched to using async gio to make the http
transfers and dropped the per-request limit to 100. The net
result is a much more responsive UI that also shows progress
more often.

I also fixed the reference leaks that prevent rhythmbox
exiting with the plugin today.

19-04-2010 - Graham Grindlay <grindlay@ee.columbia.edu> 
  * Added a few small fixes to keep the plugin from choking on bad/empty tag data. 
  * Genre tags didn't seem to be coming through properly so I set them using the "tag"
    field instead.  This seems to work fine, although if multiple tags are associated
    with a track, only the first one will be used.  If you don't like this, you can
    just comment out line 148 (self.db.set(e, rhythmdb.PROP_GENRE, e_genre))
