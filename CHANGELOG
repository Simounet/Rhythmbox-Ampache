    * rhythmbox-ampache-0.11.2: fixes for Rhythbox 0.13.3+

20-04-2010 - Philip Langdale <philipl@overt.org>

    * I did some work over the weekend to fix the blocking nature of
	  the plugin. I switched to using async gio to make the http
	  transfers and dropped the per-request limit to 100. The net
	  result is a much more responsive UI that also shows progress
	  more often.

	  I also fixed the reference leaks that prevent rhythmbox
	  exiting with the plugin today.

  * Added a few small fixes to keep the plugin from choking on bad/empty tag data. 
  * Genre tags didn't seem to be coming through properly so I set them using the "tag"
    field instead.  This seems to work fine, although if multiple tags are associated
    with a track, only the first one will be used.  If you don't like this, you can
    just comment out line 148 (self.db.set(e, rhythmdb.PROP_GENRE, e_genre))
